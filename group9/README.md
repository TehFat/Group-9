Group 9 has created a responsive website where the user can view and search for all kinds of movies, see their description and also add movies to their own list. Users will be greeted with different tabs for example the category tab where users can find movies based on different categories. They will also find the Playlist tab where they can like, remove and rate the movies.

Tahir:
n our group project, I am responsible for developing the Movie Categories and Movie Page components in our React-based movie app. My primary focus is on integrating the OMDB API to fetch and display movie data, categorizing movies into genres such as Comedy, Action, and more. I ensure that movie posters are displayed in a structured row format, enhancing the user experience. Additionally, I have implemented functionality to allow users to add movies to their playlist and view detailed movie information. My work involves handling API data efficiently while maintaining a responsive and visually appealing UI.
